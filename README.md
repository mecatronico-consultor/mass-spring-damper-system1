# mass-spring-damper-system1
MATLAB script that simulates and solves the second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for a mass-spring-damper system. The code models the system's behavior, including its response to an external force, using symbolic and numerical methods.

## The script performs the following key functions:

Defines the governing differential equation symbolically.

Calculates the general and particular solutions of the ODE.

Applies specific physical parameters and initial conditions to the system.

Numerically evaluates the solution over time.

Visualizes the system's displacement as a function of time.
